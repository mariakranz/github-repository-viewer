## Repository viewer
The application lists the required repository info.  
  
In order for application to work, you must declare in application.properties file the 'accessToken' field with your github access token:
accessToken=your_generated_gh_access_code  

I recomend for github token listed scopes:  
- repo:status,
- public_repo,
- read:user.
